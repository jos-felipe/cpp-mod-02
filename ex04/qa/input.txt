"The Babel fish," said The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quietly, "is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing all unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to your brain, rendering speech comprehensible. Put one in your ear and you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any language. The speech you hear decodes into your brain in such a way that it is instantly understandable. The remarkable thing about it, apart from the extraordinary usefulness, is that it has provoked more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation."
